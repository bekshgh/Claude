# Reports

An admin uploads an event's Excel analysis — **Feedback Form Analysis** or
**Registration Form Analysis** — and the site turns it into an interactive
report: KPI cards, charts, tables, insights and methodology.

```
.xlsx → type from sheet names → analytics sheets → ReportDocument (JSON) → draft → publish → /report/<slug>
```

## Uploading files

1. **Reports → Upload reports.** Drop one or many `.xlsx` files (up to 4 MB
   each). Every file is read first and nothing is saved yet: its type, event
   name and date come from the file.
2. Files of the same event are grouped into one project — e.g. "ÖZGE Forum S'26"
   (feedback) and "Özge S'26" (registration) both become `ozge s26`
   (`eventKey()` in `src/lib/projects/grouping.ts` ignores accents, punctuation
   and words like *Forum / Form / Analysis*). Each group is suggested to go into
   an existing project with the same name, or into a new one whose name, type
   and date (first feedback day, or the last registration day) can be edited.
   A file can be moved to another group or to a project of its own.
3. **Save** creates the projects and the reports (as drafts, or published with
   "Publish right away"). The result links to **Compare these projects** in
   Projects; with a single file, to its report page.
4. A report's page shows what was found in the file (tabs, tables, cards), which sheets were not imported and any parser warnings. Below: a
   preview of the report exactly as it will look via its link.
5. **Publish** and pick a visibility:
   - *Private* — signed-in admins only;
   - *Link* (default) — anyone with the link, the page is `noindex`;
   - *Public* — may appear in search engines.
   Drafts are admin-only whatever the visibility; for everyone else such a page is a 404.
6. A newer version of the same event: **Replace file** on the report page — the
   link and status stay.

## What is stored (and what is not)

- The uploaded file is **never stored** — it is read in memory.
- **Only the analytics sheets** listed in the type config (`01…06` and `Notes`)
  are read. Data sheets (`Cleaned Data`, `Raw Data`, `Reg Lookup`, `Theme Coding`,
  `Channel Map`, `Charts`) are not opened at all — only their size is taken for
  the preview.
- People's names in tables like *Outlier respondents* become "Respondent N" at
  parse time — they are not stored anywhere, admins included.
- Columns whose values look like emails / phones / `@handles` are dropped;
  emails and phone numbers inside text are masked.

## Parser warnings

| Message | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| *Sheet not found in the file* | A sheet the config expects is missing (e.g. renamed) | Check the sheet name; that tab simply won't show |
| *Expected section not found* | A sheet lacks an expected section heading | If the section was renamed, update `expect` in the config |
| *Section content was not recognised* | There is content under a heading that doesn't look like cards / a table / insights | Check the block's layout; see "Adding a new block" |
| *N formula cell(s) had no saved value* | Formulas without a saved result | Open the file in Excel / LibreOffice, let it recalculate, save |

A report with warnings can still be published: blocks that weren't found are not shown.

A file is rejected as a whole (with a readable error, never a 500) when it is
empty, not `.xlsx`, macro-enabled (`.xlsm`), larger than 4 MB, unpacks
suspiciously (zip bomb), most formulas have no saved values, or the type cannot
be recognised.

## How the parser works

`src/lib/reports/`:

- `xlsx.ts` — an `.xlsx` reader on `jszip` + `saxes`: cached formula values,
  number formats, merged cells; charts are never read.
- `extract.ts` — sheet parsing **anchored on headings, never on cell addresses**:
  - a section heading is an indented ALL-CAPS cell (`  SCORE SUMMARY  —  …`);
    text after `—` / `(` becomes the subtitle;
  - the heading's merged range defines the section's columns (this separates
    blocks sitting side by side on one row);
  - blank rows split a section into blocks: "LABEL / value / caption" triples →
    KPI cards, `▶ text` rows → insights, "term — definition" pairs →
    methodology, anything else → a table (header row + data rows).
- `values.ts` — meaning comes from the cell format (`0.2985` + `0.0%` → 29.9%),
  `–` → `null`, decorative `███` / `●●●○` are dropped, `22 (73%) ███` → a count
  column and a share column.
- `configs.ts` — **everything type-specific**: which sheets become which tabs,
  which sections are expected, how each table is drawn (`views`), tab names.
- `privacy.ts` — name replacement, contact columns, text masking.

The page (`src/components/reports/`) renders only the `ReportDocument` and knows
nothing about Excel.

## Adding a new block

Usually a change in `configs.ts` is enough:

1. If the new section is already recognised as a table (check with
   `npm run parse:report -- file.xlsx --summary`), add a rule to `views`:
   ```ts
   { sheet: "audience", title: /NEW SECTION/, views: (t) => [{ type: "bars", label: 0, values: [col(t, /Regs/)] }] },
   ```
   View types: `table`, `heat` (sequential / diverging), `ranked` (bars + quotes),
   `segments` (switcher), `bars`, `line`, `doughnut`, `concentration`. Find
   columns by their label with `col()`, never by index.
2. To get a warning when the block is missing, add its heading to the sheet's `expect`.
3. A new sheet is a new entry in `sheets` (tab key, label, `match` on the sheet
   name without its number).
4. If a section is recognised neither as a table nor as cards, change
   `extract.ts` — and add a test for that layout.

## Checks and tests

```bash
npm test                                         # vitest: parser, privacy, rendering
npm run parse:report -- path/to/file.xlsx --summary   # what the parser found
npm run parse:report -- path/to/file.xlsx             # full JSON
npx vitest run -u                                # update golden snapshots after an intended parser change
```

The fixtures in `fixtures/reports/` are **sanitised** copies of the real files
(analytics sheets only, no shared strings or document properties, fake names in
the outliers). The repository is public: real files with people's data are never
committed (`/*.xlsx` in `.gitignore`). A new fixture:

```bash
npm run sanitize:fixture -- ../Real_File.xlsx fixtures/reports/Real_File.xlsx
```

## Limitations

- Native Excel charts are not copied — they are rebuilt from the tables (the
  view registry in `configs.ts`). The Feedback `06 · Charts` sheet is not
  imported: its data duplicates tables on other sheets.
- Metrics are never recalculated: everything on the page comes from the file.
- No version history: replacing the file overwrites the report data.
- Reports parsed before the UI was translated may still carry old tab names
  and "Респондент N" in their JSON; the page shows them in English, and
  re-uploading the file refreshes the stored data.
- Comparing events, editing a report in the browser and Excel export are out of scope.
